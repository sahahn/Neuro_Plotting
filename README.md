Hey, so you'd like to install this package would you? I suppose you are looking to make plots. Well first clone this respository, by popping into the old command line and typing 'git clone https://github.com/sahahn/Neuro_Plotting'

Okay, next thing you do is 'cd' into that directory. Are you there? Okay, now type 'pip install .' 

Your done. Now head over into the Examples to check out how you can actually use the library to make some brain plots.
